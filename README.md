# Matrix
There is a bike race between N racers and the distance reached by.

each of them i represented by a M x N matrix where each column
represents each racer.

The matrix consists of only O sand 1 5, where 0 represents
the position of the track not yet reached and 1 represents the.
positon of the track already reached by a racer.

Forexample, if M=5 , N=5 and MxN matrixis,

‘The green cells in each column represent the distance reached by
each racer. Theracer 3 has reached the maximum distance.

Your task s to find the racerracers who reached the maximu,
distance. oF

write a program that reads two numbers M, N, and a M x N matrix
representing the distance reached by each racer, and prints a list of

numbers in ascending order representing the racers who reached
maximum distance.

Input

“The first fine of input contains two space-separated integers
representing Mand N respectively.
Thenext M lines of input contain N space-separated integers.

Output
The output should be a single fine containing a fst of integers in

‘ascending order representing the racers wh reached the maimum
distance.
